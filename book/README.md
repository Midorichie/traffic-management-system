# Intelligent Traffic Management System

A decentralized IoT-based traffic management system built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging smart contracts written in Clarity.

## Overview

This system uses IoT sensors to collect real-time traffic data and processes it through smart contracts to optimize traffic signal timing. The system ensures transparent, tamper-proof traffic management while maintaining high efficiency and reliability.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Traffic Signals Contract
- Manages traffic signal states
- Controls signal timing and phase transitions
- Implements emergency override protocols

### 2. Traffic Data Contract
- Handles IoT sensor data storage
- Validates and processes incoming traffic data
- Maintains historical traffic patterns

### 3. Signal Optimizer Contract
- Implements optimization algorithms
- Calculates optimal signal timing
- Manages cross-intersection coordination

## Development Setup

1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install -g @stacks/cli
npm install -g clarinet
```

2. Initialize Project:
```bash
clarinet new traffic-management-system
cd traffic-management-system
```

3. Run Tests:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each contract function
- Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- Minimum 50% test coverage requirement
- Automated CI/CD pipeline integration

## Security Considerations
- Data validation and sanitization
- Access control mechanisms
- Rate limiting for IoT data submissions
- Emergency failsafe mechanisms
